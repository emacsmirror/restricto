;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a command to restrict minibuffer completion
;; to the current completion candidates.  This is something several
;; completion frameworks provide: Icicles, Ido, Ivy, Helm, Selectrum
;; all have it.  It enables fast out-of-order matching.  This package
;; is completion framework agnostic and can be used, for example, with
;; the default minibuffer tab completion, or with Icomplete.

;; To use, simply bind `restricto-narrow' in
;; `minibuffer-local-completion-map'.  If you want to be able undo
;; restriction, enable `restricto-mode' and also bind
;; `restricto-widen'.

;; The `restricto-mode' global minor mode will also detect if you use
;; `minibuffer-electric-default-mode' and in that case ensure the
;; default prompt does not reappear upon restricting.

;;; Code:

(defvar restricto--mct-stack nil
  "Stack of minibuffer completion tables.")
 
(defun restricto--clear-mct-stack ()
  "Clear the completion candidate restriction stack."
  (setq restricto--mct-stack nil))

(defun restricto--no-default-if-restricted (&rest _)
  "Check if a restriction has been made.
For use as `:before-while' advice on the function
`minibuf-eldef-update-minibuffer', to keep the default from
reappearing after a restriction."
  (null restricto--mct-stack))

(define-minor-mode restricto-mode
  "Enable undoing of restriction to current matches.

undoing is done by `restricto-widen'.  Bind them to keys of your
